<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was really nice as we could bounce ideas around with each other.  If one of us got stuck, the other might have the answer or suggestion.  It felt like we were mostly looking at the wireframe and brainstorming and able to really have a complete wireframe.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I do feel like it can be a boring process when I don't want to make it beyond my skillset but knowing my past trying to set up html pages, its definitely something I need to use because it defines a clear setup of what a page will look like.  Its easier to fix a web page format or delete aspects of it if its on paper but is work wasted if setting up all the pages with no real outline and realizing that its a format I don't like.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  Definitely consistency such as header, navigation bar, body, and footer.  He had the good idea of adding a navigation bar at the bottom of the 'blog post' so that people can go forward or back once they reach the end of the post.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  I feel like I knew most but I do need to be careful with <head> which is its own section and <header> which is in the body.
