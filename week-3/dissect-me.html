What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  Well, its like an essay where the ideal is to have an outline.  In this case, its the head, body, and footer tags.  
  Common tags within the head are title and the meta UTF tags.  I'm no psychic but I'm pretty sure there's gonna be the link tag for the CSS stylesheets from now on. 
  In the body, we do not use any tags but common ones will be h1 to h6, <p>, and section elements, i.e., article, div, section.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  In an HTML page, elements get loaded from top to bottom so elements should be displayed in the order they are presented in the HTML document.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  
  Typing "html" and then clicking 'tab' is an awesome shortcut I will be using in Sublime!  And yes, definitely creating more snippets in the future as I notice patterns in typing out tags and common elements.  I'll research shortcuts if I notice I'm doing something repeatedly.  For example, when I had to switch between multiple programs repeatedly, I learned command + tab was easier to do.  I will do the same with Sublime.
