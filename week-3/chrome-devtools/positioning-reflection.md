How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

  It helps to see what can be affected by changing certain elements directly on the browser without having to edit your files and saving.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

  You can resize using height, width, and also padding.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

  An absolute position is when you chokehold an element into exactly where you want it by using margins, how far from top, bottom, left, right, etc.  A fixed position will cause an element to stay in its position no matter where on the page you scroll, as in a navigation bar that will be with you all the way.  Static just goes where it would normally go on a page, i.e., its a default.  Relative means the element will move relative to where it would NORMALLY be if you give it a top, bottom, right, left, otherwise, it will function like a static.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

  Think of a square on paper.  Padding makes the square bigger, a border makes its outline thicker/thinner, and a margin gives it space.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

  It was fun.  I got to play around and figure out why things were not working the way they were.  The best thing for me to take away from this is if code does not work out well, I can open in a browser and play around to see the results instantaneously instead of having to save/refresh/save/refresh... repeatedly.
