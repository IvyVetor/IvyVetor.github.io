1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

  I learned its much easier to add padding, borders, and margins to certain elements.  For example, its hard to apply these to links in the same <nav> section but once I placed them in a 'in-line' <ul>, I could apply the padding and margins.  The borders are more useful for chunks of material like the header, body, and footer. But if you want to apply borders to elements, some work better, like the <ul> thing

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

  Do your framework first and the CSS positioning  might not be too bad... I did not do any side <nav> bars though which can make it make it difficult to use float and positioning to make sure the content of the page looks good.  I also did not add images in the middle of my content which will require content positioning with CSS.

3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

  It was easy to apply color, size, the contents of the header, body, and footer.  The thing I struggled with was making my footer stay on the bottom otherwise, it was empty space after it and it looked wrong.

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

  Wireframing really helped with this.  As for formatting elements in CSS, I feel like I have a long way to go when I'm looking at my code.  I think its messy.
