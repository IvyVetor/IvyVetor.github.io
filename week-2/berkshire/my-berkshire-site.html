- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I have done HTML/CSS before so it is not too hard but it is fun to finally be able to put it on GitHub :)

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

This was made easier by using the HTML Validation Tool they gave us.  I did catch a few things that the tool did not, like I had my footer inside the body.  It will take practice though!  I was using header and main in the same area up top before the body which was incorrect.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I think I did okay? I wanted my code to be readable so I did my best to do so but as for formatting with CSS, I think I did okay.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

Its good that there are general rules, i.e., open tags usually have a closing tag, theres a head, body, and footer.  What makes it a little difficult is just learning that section, nav, paragraph, and span are not the same things even if they divide up content.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Practice?  It helps to just put your main tags in the document before typing anything down like head, body, and footer and other elements you know you will be using.  Just having it set up helps.
