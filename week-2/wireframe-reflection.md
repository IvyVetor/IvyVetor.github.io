[Wireframe for Blog Index](imgs/wireframe-blog-index.png)

1. What is a wireframe?
  A layout of how a page should look regarding content to be on it and how the content will be added in the future.
2. What are the benefits of wireframing?
  If a website is planned out initially with wireframing, then chances are, the future is also involved when planning the wireframe so it can handle future additions.  Also, if a wireframe design #1 does not look good, then its easier to change the design before going too far in designing the website and wasting time.
3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  Somewhat.  I do not have enough content to think about but I feel like the flow of the website is simplified.
4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  I stuck with my wireframe that I designed initially.  I think it makes the most sense.  I did see the suggestions by DBC to include social media links, picture, and navigational bar links in the index.  In the footer is where I plan to place the social media links so I might fix the wireframe picture itself to clarify this. My picture will be in my "About" page.
5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  I did not really ask any questions but I did use Gliffy that was one of the suggestions as a wireframing tool as it looked easy to use.
6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  I enjoyed being able to link the images to my files.  For the most part, I'll be excited once I have the skills to make my page more colorful.
