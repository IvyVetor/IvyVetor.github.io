1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

So the first thing you need to do is click on the "+" sign you see in the top right corner and click on "New Repository".  Name it and apply the settings you want.  When you are done, click "Create repository" at the bottom of the page.  To clone the repository to your local computer, you will need the SSH URL link that is on the repository's page on GitHub. Copy this URL and open your terminal (on Mac).  Use **$ pwd** so you know where you are on your computer inside the terminal.  To know where to go, use **$ ls** and to go to the folder, use **$ cd**.  If you want to go back a level, use **$ cd ..**. Go ahead and go to the directory you will want to save the repository to.  Once you are inside the directory you want to be in, on your terminal enter **$ git clone <SSH URL from repo>**.  It is now on your computer.

3. Describe what open source means.

It means that the code being presented is distributed freely. Anyone can use the source code to play around with it and make their own improvements/fixes/changes if they want.

4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think having open source is an amazing thing to have. It fosters a community that helps each other out with improving software, features, games, you name it.  It allows groups to use open source software and if a problem appears, there is a community to help with questions or suggestions.

5. Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses allow people to know the privileges and restrictions on the code depending on the license. They also allow the owner of the software some control and protection of what happens to the derivatives.

6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I've struggled for so long with understanding git and GitHub and these modules have helped so much in finally putting all the pieces together of what little confuzzled information I did have. It really helped to just repeat the process/cycle over and over (and present it in slightly different ways) and finally know how I can check to see if I am doing right (by using git status).

7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I did use resources on my own, notably GitHub, when you first join, which wasn't very great until I was reading on DBC resources and THIS --> **https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1** WAS AWESOME! *mind exploding internally*
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS FUN TO DO!!! I don't know if I would have understood it if I ran across it on my own but with what DBC gave me, super-easy!
